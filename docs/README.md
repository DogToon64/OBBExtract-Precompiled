# DimpsSonicLib
 A work-in-progress library for modifying files found in 2.5D Sonic games developed by Dimps Corporation

 Please take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/RadiantDerg/DimpsSonicLib/wiki)

<!-- Perhaps move Sonic Tools to their own repository? -->
## Sonic Tools
  A collection of various small (usually command-line) tools utilizing DimpsSonicLib out of the box. Compiled versions of these tools can be found on the [Releases page](https://github.com/RadiantDerg/DimpsSonicLib/releases)
 
##### **AMBExtract**:
  Unpack/repack AMB files with this tool. Supports ***most*** AMB files, with the exception of AMBs in the Windows Phone port of Sonic The Hedgehog 4 Episode I
 
##### **OBBExtract**:
  Unpack Android APK Expansion (.obb) files with this tool. Supports OBB files from both paid and ad-supported versions of Sonic The Hedgehog 4 Episode II
  
  Episode I OBBs are currently unsupported due to the game using a proprietary closed-source file compression solution from Marmalade Game Studio

  **Note:** *Re-packing the OBB files is not yet possible, however there are plans to add this feature later on once the format is better understood.*
