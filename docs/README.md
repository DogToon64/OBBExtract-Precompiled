# OBBExtract
  A tool for extracting Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode II's OBB file.
  
  Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I's OBBs are unsupported due to them using a different format. Use QuickBMS and the "vector.bms" script to extract it (it also works with the DZ files as well since they're the same format as the OBB file). (I will add links to both the tool and script later; the site isn't working as of this writing - hope it gets fixed soon.)

  **Note:** *Repacking the OBB files is not possible. I do not plan to add a repacking feature, especially since I'm not familiar with C#. Sorry, guys. :(*
