# OBBExtract
A tool for extracting Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode II's OBB file.
  
Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I's OBBs are unsupported due to them using a different format. Use QuickBMS and the "[vector.bms](https://web.archive.org/web/20250626145358if_/https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/vector.bms)" script to extract it (it also works with the DZ files as well since they're the same format as the OBB file).

**Note:** *Repacking the OBB files is not possible. I do not plan to add a repacking feature, especially since I'm not familiar with C#. Sorry, guys. :(*

*Additional notes: OBBExtract was compiled from [this commit](https://github.com/RadiantDerg/DimpsSonicLib/tree/a0568a3acd5d3b8d815b4d854f1cb055b15b413a).*
